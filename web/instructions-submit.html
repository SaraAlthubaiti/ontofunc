<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>This is a short descriptions of the fields, most directly copied from
  the <a href="http://func.eva.mpg.de">FUNC website</a>. Please check the 
<a href="http://func.eva.mpg.de/doc.html">FUNC documentation</a> if
you want to know more about the FUNC tool.</p>

<table width="520px">
  <tr valign=top>
    <th>Project Name:</th>
    <td>This is an arbitrary string to describe your project. 
      You might want to enter a meaningful name to distinguish
      between several submissions.</td>
    </tr>
  <tr valign=top>
    <th>e-mail address:</th>
    <td>An email will be sent to you after you submitted the form. 
      The email contains the link to check the status of your analysis
      and fetch the results.
      </td>
    </tr>
  <tr valign=top>
    <th>Input File:</th>
    <td>Upload your tab-separated input file here. 
      You can find a detailed description on the format 
      <a href="http://func.eva.mpg.de/doc/inputfile.html">here</td>.
    </tr>
  <tr valign=top>
    <th>Test:</th>
    <td>Choose which test should be used to analyse your data. See
    section methods
      <a href="http://func.eva.mpg.de/doc/func.html#DESCRIPTION">here</a>
      for a full description how the p-values
      are calculated.
    </tr>
  <tr valign=top>
    <th>Ontology:</th>
    <td>The Ontology over which to perform the analysis.
      We download the latest ontology versions in regular intervals (3
      months) and do not currently keep older ontology versions.</td>
    </tr>
  <tr valign=top>
    <th>Cutoff for number of genes/group:</th>
    <td>Only categories with at least <em>cutoff</em> annotations will
    be included in the analysis.</td>
    </tr>
  <tr valign=top>
    <th>Number of random sets:</th>
    <td>How many random sets should be created to asses the corrected
      p-values and the overall significance?</td>
    </tr>
  <tr valign=top>
    <th>Root nodes:</th>
    <td>Input the identifier of the ontology class that will serve as
    root node in the analysis. <tt>owl:Thing</tt> is the root node of
    any ontology class. This option is useful when classes from
    multiple ontologies are included in an ontology and you would
    like to perform the analysis only over one particular type of class.</td>
    </tr>

<h2>Data handling policy</h2>

<p>All input data is deleted once a job is completed, either
  successfully or unsuccessfully (as a result of an error). The
  results are kept for at least one year. If you would like us to
  delete your analysis results for any reasons, please send an email
