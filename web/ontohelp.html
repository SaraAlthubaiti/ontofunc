<h1>Ontologies</h1>

<p>
  The ontologies in the list are the ontologies contained in
  the <a href="http://obofoundry.org">OBO ontology library</a>. All
  ontologies contained in the OBO library are available for enrichment
  analyses. For completeness, we also make the
  varios <a href="http://obofoundry.org/index.cgi?show=mappings">mappings</a>
  between different ontologies and resources, as well as ontologies
  containing complex definitions, available for enrichment
  analyses. For example, selecting </p>
<pre>             human_phenotype logical definitions (HP_XP)</pre>
<p>
will use the ontology available
  at <a href="http://compbio.charite.de/svn/hpo/trunk/human-phenotype-ontology_xp.obo">http://compbio.charite.de/svn/hpo/trunk/human-phenotype-ontology_xp.obo</a>
  to perform enrichment analyses. Due to the inclusion of formal
  definitions, the structure of this ontology may vary from the
  structure of the Human Phenotype Ontology (HP).
